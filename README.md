# PepperTux
A fanmade SuperTux fangame (basically said fanmade game twice) made in Godot. The SuperTux logo is a placeholder here, the name "PepperTux" means nothing.

This isn't a remake / recreation of SuperTux Milestone 1.

Read tux.gd for more information.

## That one part in tux.gd if you don't want to go to the file

so basically im not trying to make a supertux milestone 1 port / remake to godot (if you want that, play supertux classic)

this is meant to be a supertux fangame where it's like supertux with new levels and in a different thing, this one being in godot.

there will be a health system (similar to retux) and the way to get more health is to touch egg power-ups

there will be multiple worlds (8 of them?)

## Credits

Literally everything in data is from SuperTux, I think.
