# pepperTux
A fanmade SuperTux fangame (basically said fanmade game twice) made in Godot. The SuperTux logo was a placeholder here until it was changed to pepperTux, the name "pepperTux" means nothing.

This isn't a remake / recreation of SuperTux Milestone 1.

if anyone could help improve the code or help add things that'd be appreciated (if that's the correct word i have no idea)

## That one part that was in tux.gd

so basically im not trying to make a supertux milestone 1 port / remake to godot (if you want that, play supertux classic)

this is meant to be a supertux fangame where it's like supertux with new levels and in a different thing, this one being in godot.

there will be a health system (similar to retux) and the way to get more health is to touch egg power-ups

there will be multiple worlds (8 of them?)
